  # Sends an email with a specific question to a user within a group context.
  #
  # This method retrieves the user's email and the group's ID, then attempts to locate an existing
  # question record for additional context. It adds application-specific headers including group,
  # question, question record, and user identifiers. A consistent Message-ID is generated and a
  # secure reply-to address is determined based on whether the question record exists. Finally,
  # an email is composed with a subject that incorporates the group's name and the question text.
  #
  # @param user [User] the recipient of the email.
  # @param group [Group] the group context associated with the question.
  # @param question [Question] the question to be sent.
  # @return [Mail::Message] the generated email message ready for delivery.

  # Sends a weekly question email to a user with custom headers.
  #
  # This method composes and sends a weekly question email. It retrieves the group's name,
  # extracts the question text for the email subject, and attempts to locate an associated question record.
  # Application-specific headers are addedâ€”including group, question, question record (if available), and user identifiers.
  # A consistent Message-ID is generated, and the reply-to address is set dynamically based on the presence
  # of a question record.
  #
  # @param user [User] The recipient of the email.
  # @param group [Group] The group used to retrieve the name and identifier for email composition.
  # @param question [Question] The question object providing the text and identifier for the email.

  # @example
  #   weekly_question(user, group, question)
  def weekly_question(user, group, question)

  # Sends a weekly digest email containing a question and its associated answers.
  #
  # Prepares and dispatches an email to a user with a weekly digest. The email includes the question text,
  # its answers, and contextual information from the corresponding group. Application-specific headers,
  # including identifiers for the group, question, question record, and user, are added to facilitate
  # tracking. A consistent Message-ID is generated to uniquely identify the email.
  #
  # @param user [User] The recipient user for the digest.
  # @param group [Group] The group context associated with the question.
  # @param question [Question] The question, from which the question text and identifier are derived.
  # @param answers [Array<Answer>] A collection of answers corresponding to the question.
  # @param record [QuestionRecord] The record used for tracking additional metadata about the question.

  # @example
