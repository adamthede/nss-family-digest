  # Sends an email containing a question to a specified user.
  #
  # This method composes and dispatches an email within a group context. It sets custom headers including the group,
  # question, and user identifiers, generates a unique Message-ID, and determines a secure reply-to address based on the
  # presence of a corresponding question record.
  #
  # @param user [User] The email recipient.
  # @param group [Group] The group associated with the question, providing context for the header and subject.
  # @param question [Question] The question content to be sent in the email.
  #
  # @return [Mail::Message] The constructed mail message.
  #
  # @example
  #   send_questions(user, group, question)
  def send_questions(user, group, question)
    email = user.email
    @question = question
    @group_id = group.id

    # Find question record if it exists

  # Sends a weekly question email containing a group question to a user.
  #
  # Retrieves the groupâ€™s name and the question content from the provided objects, locates an associated question record if one exists,
  # and sets application-specific email headers including a consistent Message-ID. The method then determines a secure reply-to address
  # based on the presence of a question record and sends an email with a subject that incorporates the group name and question.
  #
  # @param user [User] The recipient of the email, expected to have an accessible email attribute.
  # @param group [Group] The group context for the email; its ID and name are used for headers and email subject formatting.
  # @param question [Question] The question object containing the question text and identifier.
  #
  # @note The reply-to address is set by generating a secure address if a question record is found; otherwise, it falls back to the value of ENV['SENDGRID_INBOUND'].
